# NoSQL - MongoDB Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up and analyze data using a NoSQL database â€” specifically MongoDB. It consists of two primary stages:

1. Loading and cleaning raw data into MongoDB.
2. Performing analysis using PyMongo and Pandas within Jupyter Notebooks.

The goal is to showcase how MongoDB can be used for flexible schema design and effective data retrieval and analysis.
